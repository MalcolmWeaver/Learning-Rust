## Cargo

#### This example acts as an introduction to use 'cargo', Rusts build system and package manager.

#### A simple cargo package exists in the hello_cargo folder in this directory.

#### Some notable cargo commands are:

 - `cargo init`: Create a new project folder.
 - `cargo build`: Build the project.
 - `cargo run`: Build (if changes made) & run project.
 - `cargo build --release`: Build ready-for-release project, optimized for performance.

#### Please note this example has little to no advantages over rustc, it is meant as an introduction to using cargo.
